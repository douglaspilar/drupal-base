"To provide keyword searching, the search engine maintains an index of words "
"found in the content and its fields, along with text added to your content "
"by other modules (such as comments from the core Comment module, and "
"taxonomy terms from the core Taxonomy module). To build and maintain this "
"index, a correctly configured <a href=\"@cron\">cron maintenance task</a> is "
"required. Users with <em>Administer search</em> permission can further "
"configure the cron settings on the <a href=\"@searchsettings\">Search "
"settings page</a>."

"Content-related actions on your site (creating, editing, or deleting content "
"and comments) automatically cause affected content items to be marked for "
"indexing or reindexing at the next cron run. When content is marked for "
"reindexing, the previous content remains in the index until cron runs, at "
"which time it is replaced by the new content. Unlike content-related "
"actions, actions related to the structure of your site do not cause affected "
"content to be marked for reindexing. Examples of structure-related actions "
"that affect content include deleting or editing taxonomy terms, enabling or "
"disabling modules that add text to content (such as Taxonomy, Comment, and "
"field-providing modules), and modifying the fields or display parameters of "
"your content types. If you take one of these actions and you want to ensure "
"that the search index is updated to reflect your changed site structure, you "
"can mark all content for reindexing by clicking the \"Re-index site\" button "
"on the <a href=\"@searchsettings\">Search settings page</a>. If you have a "
"lot of content on your site, it may take several cron runs for the content "
"to be reindexed."
