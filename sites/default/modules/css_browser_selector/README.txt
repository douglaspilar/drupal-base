-- REQUIREMENTS --

* None


-- INSTALLATION --

Install as usual, see http://drupal.org/node/70151 for further information.


-- KNOWN ISSUES --

If everything is enabled and you're still not seeing the browser/OS classnames
in your body HTML tag, this is most likely because you are using the Garland
or similar theme where it does not output this variable.

The simple solution: modify your page.tpl.php file so that the <html> tag now contains this variable, like so:
  <html class="<?php print $body_classes; ?>">
  
The more advanced solution is to write a custom theme function to replace what currently outputs the CSS in your body tag.
